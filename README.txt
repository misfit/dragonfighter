This is an unofficial recreation of one of my favorite rpg games in history.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux/UNIX computer with at least 1GHz processor. I will not create a makefile
 for or test this game on Windows.

Required software: make, gcc, and the allegro libraries installed.

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~

game.

How to run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make
./dragonfighter

Windows:
Get a real operating system then run the above commands.
